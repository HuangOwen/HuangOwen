### Hi there 👋

This is Xijie Huang [[HomePage]](https://huangowen.github.io/), a researcher at Meta Reality Lab.

- 👨‍🎓 I was a CSE PhD student from HKUST mentored by [Prof. Tim CHENG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-SgpaF8AAAAJ&hl). I also worked with [Zechun Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lA7ylt4AAAAJ&hl=en) from Meta Reality Lab during my PhD.
- 🔭 I worked as a research intern at Snap Research 👻 Santa Monica under the supervision of [Jian Ren](https://alanspike.github.io/), working on building efficient diffusion models. I have also conducted a research internship at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) under the supervision of [Li Lyna Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lzhani/), working on the prompt pruning of LLMs.
- 🧑‍🏫 I finished my B.E. at Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2020, where I worked with [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/). I visited UCLA as a visiting research intern in 2019, where I worked with [Prof. Mani Srivastava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=X2Qs7XYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
- 👯 My research interests lie in LLMs, efficient deep learning, and human-centric computer vision. More concretely, my research interests focus on quantization, pruning, and algorithm-hardware co-design. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you are interested in collaborating with me!
