This is Xijie Huang [[HomePage]](https://huangowen.github.io/), a Ph.D. student at HKUST CSE.

- 🔭 I am currently conducting a research internship at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), working on the compression of LLMs.
- 🧑‍🏫 I finished my B.E. at Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2020, where I worked with [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/). I visited UCLA as a visiting research intern in 2019, where I worked with [Prof. Mani Srivastava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=X2Qs7XYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
- 👨‍🎓 I am now mentored by [Prof. Tim CHENG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-SgpaF8AAAAJ&hl). I have also worked with [Prof. Zhiqiang Shen](https://zhiqiangshen.com/) from MBZUAI.
- 👯 My research interests lie in the general area of artificial intelligence, particularly in model compression and its applications in computer vision. More concretely, My research interests focus on quantization, pruning, algorithm-hardware co-design, and human-centric computer vision. Please contact me if you are interested in collaborating with me!
